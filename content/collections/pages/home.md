about_me: |
  Hello! My name is Brandon but my friends call me Mxmba (mamba). My job is to make things happen on the web (Web Designer and Developer). But, how? Well, by having a clear understanding of modern technologies and best development practices, I can designed and develop anything from static websites to website applications to marketing websites, and much more. I am very passionate about my work, which makes every project a new challenge for me to build something unique and usable. By focusing on every detail I am able to build something much more than just a website. And I do all of this from my little home located in the Greater Nashville Area. 
  
  If you are in need of a website for your business or if you are looking to add some more talent to your dev team, don't hesitate in contacting me! Or if you are here just for fun, well why not say hi! ðŸ‘‹
